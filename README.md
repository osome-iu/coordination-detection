# coordination-detection

Python code to reproduce the results from the following paper:

Pacheco, D., Hui, P.-M., Torres-Lugo, C., Truong, B. T., Flammini, A., & Menczer, F. (2021). Uncovering Coordinated Networks on Social Media: Methods and Case Studies. Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 15(1), 455-466. https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v15i1.18075

Content of the folders: 

* CS1: Code to reproduce results in Case Study 1. Links between accounts are based on whether two accounts shared any handles. The data originated from the Botometer tool's requests.
* CS3: Code to reproduce results in Case Study 3. Links between accounts are based on whether two accounts shared similar sequences of hashtags. The data originated from a set of tweets.
* CS4: Code to reproduce results in Case Study 4. Links between accounts are based on whether they retweet the same tweets. The data originated from a set of tweets.
* CS5: Code to reproduce results in Case Study 5. Links between accounts are based on whether they tweet in the same time intervals. The data originated from a set of tweets.

We do not have code to reproduce the results in Case Study 2, which are based on similarity between images shared by different accounts.
