    "``Pump \\& dump\" is a shady scheme where the price of a stock is inflated by simulating a surge in buyer interest through false statements (pump) to sell the cheaply purchased stock at a higher price (dump). Investors are vulnerable to this kind of manipulation because they want to act quickly when acquiring stocks that seem to promise high future profits. By exposing investors to information seemingly from different sources in a short period of time, fraudsters create a false sense of urgency that prompts victims to act.\n",
    "\n",
    "Social media provides fertile grounds for this type of scam. We investigate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting coordinated cryptocurrency pump \\& dump campaigns on Twitter. The data was collected using keywords and cashtags (e.g., \\$BTC) associated with 25 vulnerable cryptocoins as query terms. We consider both original tweets and retweets because they all add to the stream of information considered by potential buyers. More details on the dataset are found in "

    "We hypothesize that coordinated pump \\& dump campaigns use software to have multiple accounts post pump messages in close temporal proximity. Tweet timestamps are therefore used as the behavioral trace of the accounts. \n",
    "The shorter the time interval in which two tweets are posted, the less likely they are to be coincidental. However, short time intervals result in significantly fewer matches and increased computation time. On the other hand, longer (e.g., daily) intervals produce many false positive matches. To balance between these concerns, we use 30-minute time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, it is likely that any two users would post one or two tweets that fall within any time interval; however, the same is not true for a set of more tweets. To focus on accounts with sufficient support for coordination, we only keep those that post at least eight messages. This specific support threshold value is chosen to minimize false positive matches\n",
    "\n",
    "The tweets are then binned based on the time interval in which they are posted. These time features are used to construct the bipartite network of accounts and tweet times. Edges are weighted using TF-IDF. Similar to the previous case, the projected account coordination network is weighted by the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors. Upon manual inspection, we found that many of the tweets being shared in this network are not related to cryptocurrencies, while only a small percentage of edges are about this topic. These edges also have high similarity and yield a strong signal of coordination. Thus, we only preserve the 0.5\\% of edges with largest cosine similarity "
